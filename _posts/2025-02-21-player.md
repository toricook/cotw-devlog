Yesterday I started off with the intention of rendering my player to the screen and didn't even get around to doing that -- but it's all good, because with the logic I wrote yesterday, simply rendering him to the screen would be trivial. Instead I'm going to first think about how I want to represent the player and other sprites that will move around the screen rather than staying in a fixed position. First, I think that every GameObject should have a Position, so I'm going to add that property on that class. Then I'll change the Sprite class to use that for knowing where to render.

Then there needs to be an interface that gets implemented for things that move. I'm going to call this an IMoveable that has a method for determing where the object should move.
```
  public interface IMoveable
  {
      public Vector2 GetNextPosition();
  }
```
The corresponding system will look like this:
```
public class MovementSystem
{
    public void Update()
    {
        foreach (var gameObject in ObjectStore.Instance.GetObjects())
        {
            if (gameObject is IMoveable moveable)
            {
                var pos = moveable.GetNextPosition();
                gameObject.Position = pos;
            }
        }
    }
}
```
Then I'll make a class called Player. Player will be a type of Sprite that also implements IMoveable. The position will be obtained by checking the Keyboard state.
```
public class Player : Sprite, IMoveable
{
    public Player(Texture2D texture, Rectangle source, Vector2 initialPosition) : base(texture, source, initialPosition)
    {
    }

    public Vector2 GetNextPosition()
    {
        var x = Position.X; var y = Position.Y;
        if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Left))
        {
             x -= 32;
        }

        if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Right))
        {
            x += 32;
        }

        if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Up))
        {
            y -= 32;
        }

        if (Keyboard.GetState().IsKeyDown(Keys.Down))
        {
            y += 32;
        }

        return new Vector2(x, y);
    }
}
```
The reason I change the position by 32 each time is because each tile is 32 pixels and I want to make the player move 1 tile. Eventually I'll make this less hardcoded.

HUH. Well, I think I see the problem, which is that this GetPosition method is beign called every frame, and my key presses take longer than a single frame so it's going to make him move WAY more than intended. An alternative would be to use the arrow keys to set some kind of velocity and then pass in the elapsed game time and calculate where he should be based on that. This will make him move smoothly between tiles. But in the original game, he doesn't move smoothly. Actually, the movement in the original game is kinda funky. Here's what happens when I hold the UP arrow down in the original game.

He moves one tile, pauses for a moment, and then speeds away. I'm not sure I want to copy this exactly because it seems kind of weird. My first thought was that I want the code I write here to eventually be reusable for other projects, so I should implement the smooth movement thing because it is more common. BUT I didn't end up liking how it looked, especially the fact that he could be in a position that was between two tiles.

This looks WRONG!

So I ended up implementing something similar to what I did from the beginning, but with a check that repeated presses of the same key won't continue to move the player until some delay time has passed. This allows for holding down a key to move him, but in a smoother way than in the actual game. This also required me to modify the IMoveable and MovementSystem to take in a deltaTime that comes from Game.ElapsedTime.TotalSeconds.
```
  public class Player : Sprite, IMoveable
  {
      KeyboardState _previousKeyboardState;
      const int TILE_SIZE = 32;

      public Player(Texture2D texture, Rectangle source, Vector2 initialPosition) : base(texture, source, initialPosition)
      {
      }

      const float MOVE_DELAY = 0.25f;
      float _moveTimer = 0f;

      public Vector2 GetNextPosition(float deltaTime)
      {
          var currentKeyboardState = Keyboard.GetState();
          var nextPosition = Position;

          _moveTimer += deltaTime;
          bool canMoveAgain = _moveTimer >= MOVE_DELAY;

          if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Left) &&
              (canMoveAgain || !_previousKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Left)))
          {
              nextPosition.X -= TILE_SIZE;
              _moveTimer = 0;
          }
          else if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Right) &&
              (canMoveAgain || !_previousKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Right)))
          {
              nextPosition.X += TILE_SIZE;
              _moveTimer = 0;
          }
          else if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Up) &&
              (canMoveAgain || !_previousKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Up)))
          {
              nextPosition.Y -= TILE_SIZE;
              _moveTimer = 0;
          }
          else if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Down) &&
              (canMoveAgain || !_previousKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Down)))
          {
              nextPosition.Y += TILE_SIZE;
              _moveTimer = 0;
          }

          _previousKeyboardState = currentKeyboardState;
          return nextPosition;
      }
  }
```
I also updated the viewport to follow my player around. I think this looks pretty good!

Next time, we'll tackle...collision logic! (hate)
