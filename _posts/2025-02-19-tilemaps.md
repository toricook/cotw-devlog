I ran into my first roadblock pretty much immediately, which was that even though the .exe file from the downloadable Castle of the Winds game (linked in the last post) allegedly contains all of the art, I could not figure out how to extract it. The game does not appear to be compatible with [Resource Hacker](https://www.angusj.com/resourcehacker/) and I spent about an hour looking for an alternative before deciding to give up for now. The only thing I did find was this [good samaritan on a forum](https://www.tapatalk.com/groups/cotwfr/where-can-i-get-all-the-cotw-sprites-t92.html) who provided these icons, though the bitmaps are still missing. Since the first thing I want to tackle is tiles, and the tiles are NOT in here, it's time for me to test out my art skills.

# My Art
Luckily the tiles in this game are pretty simple and there are only a handful. I am using [Aseprite](https://www.aseprite.org/) to draw these, and using screenshots from the game to get the colors. The icons are 32 by 32 pixels, so I'll choose that for my tile size as well. I'm going to make 6 tiles:

* Grass
* That weird grassy area we can't walk in, which I'm going to call farmland because maybe?
* Dirt road
* Gray dungeon wall
* White dungeon floor
* Light blue dungeon floor

Hopefully there aren't any more tiles than that, but we'll find them later if there are. So in Aseprite, I'm making a 96x64 pixel image that will hold my 6 tiles packed together. I used the eyedropper tool in Paint to get each color. I don't really care about recreating these perfectly right now cuz I'm still hoping I can find another way. I also notice that there are some tiles that are like half-wall and half-floor in the places where the walls are diagonal, but again, let's punt on that one.

# Texture Atlas
What I've just made is called a texture atlas, which according to Wikipedia is "is an image containing multiple smaller images, usually packed together to reduce overall dimensions...A sub-image is drawn using custom texture coordinates to pick it out of the atlas." One of the basic things that MonoGame is handling for me is rendering stuff to the screen, and it does this by taking an image that I provide and loading it in as a Texture2D (which is a MonoGame class). When I am tell MonoGame to render a Texture2D to the screen using the SpriteBatch.Draw() method (something we will understand better later when we start coding), I can also give it a subregion of that Texture2D that I want it to render (basically a Rectangle that cuts out the part of the Texture2D that I actually want to draw). This way, I can load in a single png at the start of my game, and draw all my tiles just by referencing some sub-Rectangle of that png that corresponds to the tile I'm interested in, instead of loading in a separate png per tile. This is, like, probably more memory efficient or something.

So to review, my tile texture atlas is 96 by 64 and contains 6 tiles. If I want to grab the first tile, the grass, I provide SpriteBatch.Draw() with the texture atlas and a subrectable with an x and y coordinate of (0,0) (corresponding to the top left corner) and a width and height of 32. If I wanted to access the white dungeon floor, my rectangle is still 32 by 32 but now I have to give it a top coordinate of (32, 32) which tells the renderer where my rectangle starts. We will definitely want to come up with a way in our code to keep track of these things so we don't rely on hardcoding these values everywhere, which will be prone to mistakes.

# Tilemap
Our levels are going to be pretty simple, so for now, to get off the ground the quickest, I want to come up with a very simple way of storing level data that can be parsed and rendered to the screen. CSV format will be really easy for me to make and debug, and it's also one of the save formats offered by Tiled (which I'll get to in a second). So, I'll plan to store my maps as .csv files where each ROW is separated by a newline. The value at each position will be an ID corresponding to one of our tiles (easy to handle since there are only 6). I'll use -1 when I don't want to render anything (like the void outside of the outer walls of the dungeon). In other words, a csv that looks like this: 
```
-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
-1,3,3,3,3,3,3,-1
-1,3,4,4,4,4,3,-1
-1,3,4,4,4,4,3,-1
-1,3,4,4,4,4,3,-1
-1,3,4,4,4,4,3,-1
-1,3,3,3,3,3,3,-1
-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1,-1
```

Gets rendered like this:

# Tiled
Even writing the CSV above was pretty annoying, which is where [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org/) comes in. Tiled is going to let me make my tilemaps by dragging and dropping from my texture atlas, and then exporting as a CSV that will look just like the above. All I need to know is how Tiled assigns IDs to my tiles (once I provide it with the information that my tiles are 32x32, it will slice the atlas and assign IDs from left to right, top to bottom, starting from 0), and then I can write a script to parse the CSVs into my game. This parsing script isn't even going to care that the CSVs came from Tiled or not, so I can still make my own by hand like the little example above and the same code will still work. Yay!

For this post, I am just going to attempt to draw the little town area where the game starts, which I painstakingly mapped out the layout of by walking around and scribbling on some graph paper. Obviously I don't have the bitmaps for the shops and other little things, which sucks but is a problem for later.

# Rendering the Map
After exporting the tilemap, we are ready to render it. After creating a new MonoGame template, the first thing I'll do is change the resolution (by default, MonoGame sets the window size to 800x400). The resolution of this game is 640x480 (from measuring my screenshot), but some of this is dedicated to our info bars at the top and bottom of the screen. So for now, we're going to be able to see a bit more of the map than expected.

I don't want to start discussing the architecture in this post, though I do have some idea of how I want to do that. But for now, I'm going to make 2 classes: a Tilemap and a TilemapRenderer. The Tilemap is just a wrapper around a dictionary that contains coordinates and an ID to the tile that should be drawn at that coordinate (NOTE: thought about making this a 2D array. But I actually don't need to store any data on the "void" tiles because I just won't render anything there, so the dictionary will only contain the info that matters and could potentially be much smaller than the full array). The Tilemap also has a method to parse this information from a csv. The TilemapRenderer contains the texture atlas and configuration information (how many tiles per row are in my atlas, and the size of each tile). The TileampRenderer has a render method that takes in a Tilemap, iterates through it, and renders the specified tile at each position to the screen (via the SpriteBatch). I separated the two classes this way because we really only need one TilemapRenderer for our whole game, since our texture atlas won't change. Again, this may not be the final architecture but it works for now.

Lastly, my TilemapRenderer can take in an offset and move the location of each tile by that offset. By adding logic in my Update loop to read keyboard inputs, I can use the arrow keys to change this offset, and in this way I can "pan around" the map (since the whole thing won't be visible at this resolution). Later we'll need to make a player-following camera, but this is fine for debugging for now.

One last thing -- you may be able to see that the farmland flickers when moving around. I have some idea of what's going on here...but we'll look into it next time!
